# arch-installer
This is my arch linux installer script. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My arch linux installer script is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My arch linux installer script, without me, is useless. Without my arch linux installer script, I am useless.

## Instructions
Copy `config.sh.example` to `config.sh` and edit the values otherwise you will get useless defaults.

Run `./install.sh`
